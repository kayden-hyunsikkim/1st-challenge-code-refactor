# code-refactor

## Description

This code-refactor was created to practice how to refact the base code to get more accessbility. It contains notes on HTML, CSS.<br>
I changed the base html code elements which are not inapposite for semanic and changed CSS selectors to match the elements which I changed.<br>
Also I merged and deleted some selectors to prevent repetition of code.<br>
I learned there is no need meaningless class or id attributes if the html semantic elements are well set up.
