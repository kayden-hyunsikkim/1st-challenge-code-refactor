# code-refactor

## Description

This code-refactor was created to practice how to refact the base code to get more accessbility. It contains notes on HTML, CSS.
I changed the base html code from divs to right semantic elements and changed CSS selectors to match the elements which I changed.
I learned there is no need meaningless class or id attributes if the html semantic elements are well set up.
